About PandoraEnchants

PandoraEnchants is a comprehensive custom enchantment plugin designed for Factions servers running Spigot/Paper 1.21. It introduces a unique "One Enchant Per Item" mechanic to maintain strict PvP balance while offering powerful abilities. The plugin features a robust system of over 50 custom enchantments, "God Sets" that bypass limitations, and full integration with vanilla Enchanting Tables and Anvils.

Key Features

Balanced Gameplay: Enforces a strict limit of one custom enchantment per item to prevent power creep.

Unique Enchantments: Includes powerful effects like Lifesteal, Rage, Vein Miner, Lumberjack, Double Jump, and more.

God Sets: Special pre-configured armor sets (Iron, Diamond, Netherite) that bypass the one-enchant restriction, allowing for ultimate "God" gear.

GUI Editor: A live preview editor (/pe editor) to view and manage enchantments directly in-game.

Vanilla Integration:

Enchanting Table: Custom enchants can be obtained naturally through the enchanting table.

Anvil Support: Combine custom enchanted items and books with configurable costs.

Visual Effects: High-quality particle effects and sounds for immersive combat and mining.

Smart Mechanics:

Vein Miner & Lumberjack: Break entire veins of ore or trees instantly.

Double Jump: Launch into the air with special boots.

Auto Smelt & Telekinesis: Automatically smelt ores and send drops directly to inventory.
